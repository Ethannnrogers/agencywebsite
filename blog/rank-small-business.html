                                <p>
                                    When a user searches for services on Google Maps, Google provides a list of businesses in their area 
                                    that provide those services. When a user makes a traditional Google search, the user is first prompeted 
                                    with three listings from the Google Maps My Business listings. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    When someone in your area is searching for the services your business offers, what
                                    will they find? Will they see your business name, location, address, hours of operation, 
                                    phone number, customer reviews and a link to your website? Every single day there are people 
                                    in your area searching for the services your business 
                                    provides. If you don’t have your business properly listed, Google will suggest that those 
                                    customers to go to your competitors.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Here are some tips on how you can take advantage of the opportunity Google Maps listings 
                                    provide and start taking back all of the leads you’re missing out on.

                                <br><br>
                                <h3>Claim Your Google My Business Listing</h3>
                                <p>
                                        What used to be called Google Places, <a class="blog-link" href="https://www.google.com/business/">Google My Business</a>  
                                        gives you the ability to list your business on Google Maps and have 
                                        full control over the Google search results for your business. Google My 
                                        Business listings consist of a variety of relevant information for your business 
                                        (Hours of Operation, Address, Phone Number, Website Link, etc) making it easier for 
                                        consumers in your area to find you.
                                        <br><br>
                                        To claim your business now go to google.com/business and click Start now at the top right corner. 
                                        You will then need to sign to your Google account, or create one.
                                        (Make sure to use the account that you want people to see managing the business)
                                        Continue to follow Google’s instructions by filling out the rest of the information for your business.
                                        
                                </p>
                                <br><br>
                                <h2>Verify Your Business</h2>
                                <p>
                                    After you claim your business, you’ll want to get it verified. Verifying your business is a process that Google 
                                    has you go through to make sure that the location of your business is acurate. Once Google can verify your business, they will 
                                    allow you to add more content to your My Business Listing. Most often, Google will need to mail you a letter with a 
                                    code on it to verify that you are the address the business is listed under is valid. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    In some cases, businesses can also verify by phone or email. Businesses that have already been verified with the Google 
                                    Search Console can instantly get verified.
                                </p>
                                <br><br>
                                <h2>Provide A Complete Description of Your Business</h2>
                                <p>
                                    To outrank competitors in your area, you will want to optimize your business listing. The first step is to be sure that all 
                                    of the information you are listing is completely accurate. It’s obvious how misspelling or leaving off information can hurt 
                                    the ranking of the listing but the everytime you make a change to the listing, the ranking process starts over.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Be sure to include any and all relevant information for your business that will make it easier for customers to answer their 
                                    questions about you. Make sure that it is easy to see exactly what services your business is offering, where the business is located, 
                                    and most importantly, how they can get in touch with you.
                                </p>
                                <br><br>
                                <h2>Use Keywords</h2>
                                <p>
                                    A lot like traditional SEO, Google uses relevant keywords inside of your Google My Business listing to determine which listing 
                                    should be ranked higher. Makes sure that your listing has the most relevant keywords for your business, and that the keywords are 
                                    used consistently throughout the listing. Take a look at what your competitors business listing looks like as reference. The 
                                    keywords used most frequently in their listing is always a safe bet for you to use.
                                </p>
                                <br><br>
                                <h2>Keep Operating Hours Up-to-Date</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Having accurate operating hours for your business are very important, specifically when they change. Around the holidays, make sure 
                                    to update when for non-frequent closings. Google provides the option to customize the business hours just for the holidays or special events.
                                </p>
                                <br><br>
                                <h2>Add Photos</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Be sure to include professional, high-quality images of your business and/or the services that your business provides. Business that have more 
                                    than 5 images on their listing receive 40% more driving direction requests and over 35% more website clicks.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Make sure that the images you are using accurately describe the business. You want to be as transparent as you can but also create an appeal 
                                    for the customers to come to you. If you mislead customers you may screw up the next topic, which is customer reviews.
                                        
                                </p>
                                <br><br>
                                <h2>Get Great Customer Reviews</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Having positive reviews for your business can literally make or break your business. Good reviews, but even better, a lot of good reviews 
                                    tells people makes people want to use your business. Positive reviews help customers decide which company to go with when deciding between competitors. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Having a quantity of positive reviews is very important because it helps rank your business against competitors. To get to #1 on Google Maps listings and 
                                    stay there, you must have a great <a class="blog-link" href="">Review Generation Campaign</a> in place so your business is constantly getting positive reviews.
